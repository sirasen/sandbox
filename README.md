# Description

This repository contains some data science related samples used during the Coursera courses.

# Prerequisites

- Install [Python 3.12 or higher](https://www.python.org/).
- Create a Python Virtual Environment:

```
$cd sandbox

# Create the Virtual Environment
$python -m venv .venv
```

# Installing dependencies

```
$cd sandbox

# Activate Virtual Environment. Script to run depends on shell - see 
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work. This
# needs to be done every time you open a shell because otherwise there
# is a risk that dependencies are installed in the default Python 
# installation directory and not in the Virtual Environment!
$./.venv/Scripts/Activate

$pip install .
```
